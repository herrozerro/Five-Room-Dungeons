Mission Datacard

The Black Lotus hypercorp has been on our radar for quite some time now.  And their latest venture is no exception.  A Hab, designated Black Lotus New Developments (BL / ND), has piqued out interest with a ... well new development.  It is a specialized Hab (See Attached intelligence.), in orbit within sol's corona, with a state purpose of being a High Energy Experimental Complex.  

We've had a contact inside the station for some time.  They have been keeping us appraised about potential risks.  But only two days ago we received a single character transmission from our contact. "X".  We fear some kind of unknown X threat, or at least a cover up of one.  Yesterday, one of our mercurial cells reported that they spotted BL / ND with a polar telescope moving off course. This has been confirmed.  The whole station appears to be in a degrading orbit.  Estimated to become unsalvageable within ten days unless corrected.  

We suspect that Black Lotus is either covering up some kind of X threat, or 

Polar telescopes on mercury have been keeping an eye on the station, but it's been drifting off course, prompting this mission.Â  Predictions show that within 20 hours the station's orbit will be pushed out of delta V(dV) range of our shuttles. What is strange is that the station should not have the dV for these maneuvers.

Your mission: report the status of the station, secure the facility, and get it back on course.
