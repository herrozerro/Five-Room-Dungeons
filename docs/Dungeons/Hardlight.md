# Hard Light

A village of people acting in a cult like manner seem to be guarding a terrible secret, and the PCs seem to be stopped at every turn to leave.

## Background

Traveling in the wilderness the PCs are forced to flee a danger.  They find solace after crossing the threshold of a series of monoliths that produces a field that repels the danger.
But the danger is still out there, and even if they manage to avoid it, they discover that they are prevented from leaving just as well.
With the only option to move forward they will discover a village at the center of what they discover to be a circle of monoliths that can be seen on the horizon.  Looming over the center of the city is a monolith double the size previously seen.
The people of the village seem helpful, but no one seems willing to talk about the monoliths.  Some even may be violently opposed to it.  How can the PCs get out?
