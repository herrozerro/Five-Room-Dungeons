# BL / ND


In orbit over Mercury the research station owned by the Black Lotus corporation for New Development (Designation: BL / ND) races around the closest planet to the sun using the plentiful energy to power it’s high energy experiments.  


The station has a habit of going silent for days on end.  It's the price paid for having some of the most bleeding edge researchers.  You have to deal with eccentricity. But it's been 17 days since the last check in, and the higher ups are wanting answers.


Polar telescopes have been keeping an eye on the station, but it's been drifting off course, prompting this mission.  Predictions show that within 20 hours the station's orbit will be pushed out of dV range of our shuttles. What is strange is that the station should not have the dV for these maneuvers.


Your mission: report the status of the station, secure the facility, and get it back on course.


Prepare for ascent.
