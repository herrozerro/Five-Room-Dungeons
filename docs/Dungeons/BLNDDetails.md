## Background

Black Lotus has been one of the leaders in innovation.  For years they have been coming out with upgrades to many common technologies.  Always seeming to one up the competition as soon as they release something new.

How they've managed to do this is all thanks to their new CTO.  Adissa Johanson.  Who in addition to being a brilliant scientist also is an Exsurgent Worm.  She is working towards bringing an Alien threat to the Sol system.

She has finally made all of her moves and has brought a recently "discovered" artifact to one of their research stations and has begun the process of activating it.  Approximately a month ago she initiated an experiment that started a chain of events that went unstopped.  

It first attacked one of the head researchers, Steti Aramanska, and once he was taken over the process began.  Adissa has holed up with the surviving members of the crew.  Aaron Blake, Sanders, Mari, and Bob.  They are currently holed up in Hab 5

## Habs

### Hab 1 -- Command

### Hab 2 -- Biolabs/Greenhouse

This hab is relatively unscathed.  

### Hab 3 -- HE Lab 1

This hab is completely gone.  It has been detonated and the resulting cloud of shrapnel causes a complicaton for the arriving ship.  

### Hab 4 -- Datacenter 1

The main server of the system.  This server controls all of the main station functions

### Hab 5 -- Main Living Quarters

This is where the survivors are holed up.  

### Hab 6 -- Datacenter 2

This server is the main processing station of all of the data generated from experiments. Dr. Carol is the resident Infomorph.  He has put into place protocols to airgap this hab from the rest of the network.  With lockdown procedures in place, the only way to access this hab is to brute force it.  

### Hab 7 -- [Restricted] HE Lab 2

The gate is being constructed here.  Using the biomass from the biomorphs, the infected Steti is building a proto-pandora gate to bring something through.  Something with lots of tentacles.

### Hab 8 -- [Restricted] Artifact Storage
